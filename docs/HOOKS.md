# Hooks

TermOS can run a shell command when something happens in a session: a window
opens, focus moves, the workspace changes, a client attaches. Hooks are
configured in the TOML config file and run asynchronously, so a slow hook does
not stall the interface.

## Configuration

Hooks live under a `[hooks]` table in the TermOS config file (run
`termos config path` to find it). Each key is an event name and each value is
either a single command or a list of commands:

```toml
[hooks]
after-new-window = "notify-send 'TermOS' \"opened $TERMOS_WINDOW_NAME\""
after-attach = [
  "logger termos attached to $TERMOS_SESSION_ID",
  "~/.config/termos/on-attach.sh",
]
```

Commands run through `sh -c`, so pipes, redirection and shell variable
expansion all work. An unknown event name is ignored with a log line naming the
valid events; it is not a fatal config error.

## Events

All nine events fire. Each one lists the fields of the payload that are
meaningful for it; the rest are present but zero.

| Event | Fires when | Payload beyond the common fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `after-new-window` | A window has been created, from a keybinding, the command palette, a tape script, or another client | `TERMOS_WINDOW_ID`, `TERMOS_WINDOW_NAME` |
| `after-close-window` | A window has been closed | `TERMOS_WINDOW_ID`, `TERMOS_WINDOW_NAME` |
| `after-focus-change` | Focus has moved to a different window | `TERMOS_WINDOW_ID`, `TERMOS_WINDOW_NAME` |
| `after-workspace-switch` | The visible workspace has changed | `TERMOS_WORKSPACE`, `TERMOS_PREV_WORKSPACE` |
| `after-attach` | This client has attached to a session and restored it, including when switching to a different session | `TERMOS_SESSION_ID` |
| `after-detach` | This client is leaving a session that keeps running | `TERMOS_SESSION_ID` |
| `after-layout-change` | The layout has changed, including tiling being turned on or off | `TERMOS_LAYOUT` |
| `after-resize` | A window has settled at a new size | `TERMOS_WINDOW_ID`, `TERMOS_WIDTH`, `TERMOS_HEIGHT` |
| `after-agent-state` | A pane's agent state changed to one you asked to be alerted about | `TERMOS_WINDOW_ID`, `TERMOS_WINDOW_NAME`, `TERMOS_AGENT_STATE`, `TERMOS_AGENT_PREV_STATE`, `TERMOS_AGENT_HARNESS`, `TERMOS_AGENT_MESSAGE` |

Notes on when these do and do not fire:

- `after-workspace-switch` does not fire when the requested workspace is
  already the visible one.
- `after-resize` fires once per completed resize. A mouse drag produces one
  event on release carrying the final size, not one per mouse-motion event. A
  keyboard resize produces one event per keypress, since each press is a
  finished resize.
- `after-detach` fires when a client detaches from a session that outlives it.
  Quitting kills the session, which is not a detach, so quitting does not fire
  it.
- `after-layout-change` reports the layout that is now in force, not the one
  being left.
- `after-agent-state` is the one event gated by configuration rather than by the
  raw fact. It fires for the transitions `[notifications.agent]` alerts on, after
  the same settle window and under the same master switch, so it is a sink
  alongside the notification and the bell rather than a firehose of every flip.
  Details of that policy are in
  [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#the-notificationsagent-table). It does not
  fire for a pane that is already in a state when a client first sees it, since
  that is not a transition, so reattaching does not replay every agent at you.

## Environment Variables

Every hook command receives the full parent environment plus:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `TERMOS_EVENT` | The event name, for example `after-new-window`. Lets one script serve several events |
| `TERMOS_SESSION_ID` | Name of the session the event came from |
| `TERMOS_WORKSPACE` | Workspace the event applies to |
| `TERMOS_WINDOW_ID` | Stable ID of the window, empty for events with no window |
| `TERMOS_WINDOW_NAME` | The window's terminal title, as set by the shell or program running in it. This is not the custom name set with `Ctrl+B` `r`, and it is empty for events with no window and for a window whose program has not set a title yet |
| `TERMOS_PREV_WORKSPACE` | Workspace active before an `after-workspace-switch`, `0` otherwise |
| `TERMOS_LAYOUT` | Layout after an `after-layout-change`: `bsp`, `master-stack`, `scrolling` or `floating`. Empty otherwise |
| `TERMOS_WIDTH`, `TERMOS_HEIGHT` | Window size in cells after an `after-resize`, `0` otherwise |
| `TERMOS_AGENT_STATE` | The state the pane moved into: `working`, `needs_input`, `idle`, `done`, `errored` or `none`. Empty for every other event |
| `TERMOS_AGENT_PREV_STATE` | The state it came from, same vocabulary. Empty for a pane that had no state before |
| `TERMOS_AGENT_HARNESS` | The harness id the reporting source named, for example `claude`. Empty when nothing named one, which includes every pane the foreground detector recognised on its own |
| `TERMOS_AGENT_MESSAGE` | The free-text note reported alongside the state, for example what the agent is waiting for. Empty when none was sent |

The agent fields are passed as environment rather than arguments for the same
reason as everything else here: `TERMOS_AGENT_MESSAGE` is free text written by a
harness, and it must not be able to break a command line or shift the position
of a later field.

## Examples

Track the focused window for an external status bar:

```toml
[hooks]
after-focus-change = "echo $TERMOS_WINDOW_NAME > /tmp/termos-focus"
```

Different behavior per workspace:

```toml
[hooks]
after-workspace-switch = "~/.config/termos/workspace.sh"
```

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# ~/.config/termos/workspace.sh
case "$TERMOS_WORKSPACE" in
  1) light-theme ;;
  *) dark-theme ;;
esac
logger "termos: workspace $TERMOS_PREV_WORKSPACE -> $TERMOS_WORKSPACE"
```

Send an agent alert to your phone. This is what the hook exists for: it reaches a
machine TermOS cannot see, and it keeps working on platforms TermOS has no built-in
sink for.

```toml
[hooks]
after-agent-state = 'curl -s -d "$TERMOS_WINDOW_NAME is $TERMOS_AGENT_STATE" ntfy.sh/my-topic'
```

The same command can be written as `[notifications.agent] command = "..."`, which
registers it for this event and puts it beside the toggles that gate it. Both
spellings are honoured, and a config with both runs both.

Alert only on the state that means the agent is stuck, whatever the config
allows through:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# ~/.config/termos/agent.sh
[ "$TERMOS_AGENT_STATE" = "needs_input" ] || exit 0
notify-send "termos" "$TERMOS_WINDOW_NAME: ${TERMOS_AGENT_MESSAGE:-waiting for you}"
```

One script handling several events, dispatching on `TERMOS_EVENT`:

```toml
[hooks]
after-attach = "~/.config/termos/session.sh"
after-detach = "~/.config/termos/session.sh"
```

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# ~/.config/termos/session.sh
case "$TERMOS_EVENT" in
  after-attach) systemctl --user start my-dev-services ;;
  after-detach) systemctl --user stop my-dev-services ;;
esac
```

## Behavior and Limits

- Hooks run asynchronously, each in its own process. TermOS does not wait for
  them and does not read their output, so a slow or hanging hook cannot freeze
  the interface.
- The one exception is `after-detach`, which the client waits on for up to two
  seconds before exiting. Without that wait the hook process would be discarded
  unrun, since the client exits immediately after firing it. A hook that takes
  longer is abandoned rather than allowed to hold the client open.
- Output and exit status are discarded. A hook that needs to report something
  should write to a file, a logger, or a notification daemon.
- Hooks run on the client, not the daemon, which for `after-agent-state` means a
  session with nobody attached fires nothing at all. Agent state keeps being
  tracked while you are detached; the alert about it happens when a client is
  there to raise it. In a multi-client session each
  attached client fires its own hooks for the events it observes.
- Hooks are read at startup from the config file.
